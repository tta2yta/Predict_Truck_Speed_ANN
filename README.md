# Predict_Truck_Speed_ANN
A python code that  predicts linearly dependent data (truck speed) using artificial neural networks of direct propagation. 

This paper briefly describes the prediction of the speed of the dump truck using artificial neural networks. The article describes  the data cleaning and processing, and prediction with artificial neural networks with the Keras model.
